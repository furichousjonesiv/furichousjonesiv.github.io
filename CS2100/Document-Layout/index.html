        <h2>Swimming: A Healthier You</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome! We believe swimming is a sport for life. Unlike gymnastics, american football,
          or other contact sports, swimming is a sport for all ages.
          You can start swimming anytime or come back, even after many years, and get back into shape.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this were a real site, it would be the ideal place to come to learn more about swimming, whether
          you are a beginner looking to learn how to swim,
          or a competitive swimmer looking to share their experience, tips, and photos with other like-minded people.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what are you waiting for? Get your swim suit, goggles and towel and head to the nearest lake or pool.
          (If you&quot;re a beginner you may want to
          head to the nearest pool for lessons!)
